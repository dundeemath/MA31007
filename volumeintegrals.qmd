In some ways these are the easiest integrals we see in this module. It's basically the same steps as before:

1. Parameterise the volume.
2. Find the element $dV$ for that parameterisation.
3. Replace the integral $\int_V$ with ordinary integrals $\int_a^b$ with the correct limits.
4. Compute the value of the triple integral.

However, the parameterisation of 3D volume needs 3 parameters, and we already know how to parameterise 3D space: that's a co-ordinate system.
So it's a case of choosing the co-ordinate system which best describes the volume you're interested in, and working out the correct limits.
The element $dV$ for a given co-ordinate system is the product of the scale factors.

For Cartestians,
$$
dV = h_x h_y h_z \,dx\,dy\,dz = dx\,dy\,dz,
$$
for cylindrical polars,
$$
dV = h_\rho h_\phi h_z \,d\rho\,d\phi\,dz = \rho d\rho\,d\phi\,dz,
$$
and for spherical polars,
$$
dV = h_r h_\phi h_\theta \,dr\,d\phi\,d\theta = r^2\sin \theta \,dr\,d\phi\,d\theta.
$$

### Example: volume of a sphere
Calculate the volume of the sphere $x^2+y^2+z^2 \leq R^2$.

### Example
Calculate the volume integral
$$
\int_V z^3 dV
$$
where $V = \{(x,y,z)\in\mathbb{R}\,|\,0\leq z\leq 1,\,x^2+y^2\leq z^2\}$.

Hint: this is a cone.

## Solution
The set is given in Cartesian co-ordinates, but don't let that fool you: it will get very messy if you try to do this in Cartesians.

The $x^2+y^2$ should make you think of cylindrical co-ordinates, since $\rho^2=x^2+y^2$. Then you get
$$V = \{(\rho,\phi,z)\,|\,0\leq z\leq 1,\,\rho\leq z\},$$
which is more obviously a cone (sketch in the $\phi=0$ plane).

Implicit in this definition is that $\phi$ can take any value between $0$ and $2\pi$ as usual.

So now we can put it all together:
$$
\int_V z^3 dV = \int_0^z d\rho \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi \int_0^1 dz z^3 \rho,
$$
with the extra $\rho$ coming from thee scale factor $h_\phi$.

The $\phi$ integral is easy because $\phi$ does not appear in the integrand. We need to be careful with the order of the other two, because the limits for $\rho$ depend on $z$:
$$
\int_V z^3 dV = 2\pi  \int_0^1 z^3 \left(\int_0^z \rho d\rho\right) dz = 2\pi \int_0^1 z^3\, \frac{1}{2} z^2 dz = \frac{1}{6}
$$
