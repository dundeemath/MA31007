    "text": "In some ways these are the easiest integrals we see in this module. It’s basically the same steps as before:\n\nParameterise the volume.\nFind the element \\(dV\\) for that parameterisation.\nReplace the integral \\(\\int_V\\) with ordinary integrals \\(\\int_a^b\\) with the correct limits.\nCompute the value of the triple integral.\n\nHowever, the parameterisation of 3D volume needs 3 parameters, and we already know how to parameterise 3D space: that’s a co-ordinate system. So it’s a case of choosing the co-ordinate system which best describes the volume you’re interested in, and working out the correct limits. The element \\(dV\\) for a given co-ordinate system is the product of the scale factors.\nFor Cartestians, \\[\ndV = h_x h_y h_z \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz = dx\\,dy\\,dz,\n\\] for cylindrical polars, \\[\ndV = h_\\rho h_\\phi h_z \\,d\\rho\\,d\\phi\\,dz = \\rho d\\rho\\,d\\phi\\,dz,\n\\] and for spherical polars, \\[\ndV = h_r h_\\phi h_\\theta \\,dr\\,d\\phi\\,d\\theta = r^2\\sin \\theta \\,dr\\,d\\phi\\,d\\theta.\n\\]\n\nExample: volume of a sphere\nCalculate the volume of the sphere \\(x^2+y^2+z^2 \\leq R^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nTODO\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\nCalculate the volume integral \\[\n\\int_V z^3 dV\n\\] where \\(V = \\{(x,y,z)\\in\\mathbb{R}\\,|\\,0\\leq z\\leq 1,\\,x^2+y^2\\leq z^2\\}\\).\nHint: this is a cone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe set is given in Cartesian co-ordinates, but don’t let that fool you: it will get very messy if you try to do this in Cartesians.\nThe \\(x^2+y^2\\) should make you think of cylindrical co-ordinates, since \\(\\rho^2=x^2+y^2\\). Then you get \\[V = \\{(\\rho,\\phi,z)\\,|\\,0\\leq z\\leq 1,\\,\\rho\\leq z\\},\\] which is more obviously a cone (sketch in the \\(\\phi=0\\) plane).\nImplicit in this definition is that \\(\\phi\\) can take any value between \\(0\\) and \\(2\\pi\\) as usual.\nSo now we can put it all together: \\[\n\\int_V z^3 dV = \\int_0^z d\\rho \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_0^1 dz z^3 \\rho,\n\\] with the extra \\(\\rho\\) coming from thee scale factor \\(h_\\phi\\).\nThe \\(\\phi\\) integral is easy because \\(\\phi\\) does not appear in the integrand. We need to be careful with the order of the other two, because the limits for \\(\\rho\\) depend on \\(z\\): \\[\n\\int_V z^3 dV = 2\\pi  \\int_0^1 z^3 \\left(\\int_0^z \\rho d\\rho\\right) dz = 2\\pi \\int_0^1 z^3\\, \\frac{1}{2} z^2 dz = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]",

Think about those wind maps on the weather forecast, or magnetic field lines around a magnet.\nTo know a vector field, we need to know each of its components at each point in space. \\[\n{\\mathbf{F}}(x,y,z) = F_1(x,y,z){\\mathbf{e}}_x + F_2(x,y,z){\\mathbf{e}}_y + F_3(x,y,z){\\mathbf{e}}_z,\n\\] or equivalently in a different co-ordinate system.\nFirstly, given any vector field we can easily construct a scalar field by taking the magnitude at each point in space, \\[\n\\left|{\\mathbf{F}}(x,y,z)\\right|=\\sqrt{F_1(x,y,z)^2 + F_2(x,y,z)^2 + F_3(x,y,z)^2}\n\\] and then take scalar derivatives. More on that next week.\nWe consider two different types.\n\nThe divergence of a vector field\nThis one takes a vector field and gives the answer as a scalar field, and the interpretation is “how much is the vector field pointing apart.” In Cartesian co-ordinates, the definition is \\[\n\\nabla\\cdot {\\mathbf{F}} = {\\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial x}} + {\\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial y}} + {\\frac{\\partial F_3}{\\partial z}}.\n\\]\nTODO\n\n\nThe curl of a vector field\nThis one takes a vector field and gives another vector field, and the interpretation is “how much is the vector field rotating.” It’s a vector because the direction represents the axis of rotation and\nTODO\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nJust like the cross product, the curl is only defined in three dimensions. Sometimes people talk about 2D curls, but they’re a bit different and much less important, so we’ll ignore this.",
