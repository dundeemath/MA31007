    "text": "Basis vectors & scale factors\nThe definition of a basis vector is the direction you move from a point in space if you increase a particular co-ordinate. So moving in the direction of \\({\\mathbf{e}}_x\\) increases the value of \\(x\\) but keeps \\(y\\) constant. It’s usually assumed to be a unit vector.\nIn practice, the definition is to differentiate \\({\\mathbf{r}}\\) with respect to the variable and then normalise: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n{\\mathbf{e}}_\\rho &= \\frac{\\partial {\\mathbf{r}}}{\\partial \\rho}/\\left|\\frac{\\partial {\\mathbf{r}}}{\\partial \\rho}\\right|\n\\\\ &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\rho} [\\rho \\cos \\phi,\\,\\rho\\sin\\phi] / \\left|\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\rho} [\\rho \\cos \\phi,\\,\\rho\\sin\\phi]\\right|\n\\\\ &= [\\cos\\phi,\\,\\sin\\phi] / \\sqrt{\\cos^2 \\phi + \\sin^2 \\phi}\n\\\\ &= [\\cos\\phi,\\,\\sin\\phi]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] and \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n{\\mathbf{e}}_\\phi &= \\frac{\\partial {\\mathbf{r}}}{\\partial \\phi}/\\left|\\frac{\\partial {\\mathbf{r}}}{\\partial \\phi}\\right|\n\\\\ &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} [\\rho \\cos \\phi,\\,\\rho\\sin\\phi] / \\left|\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} [\\rho \\cos \\phi,\\,\\rho\\sin\\phi]\\right|\n\\\\ &= [-\\rho\\sin\\phi,\\,\\rho\\cos\\phi] / \\sqrt{\\rho^2\\cos^2 \\phi + \\rho^2\\sin^2 \\phi}\n\\\\ &= [-\\sin\\phi,\\,\\cos\\phi].\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNote that this also works for Cartestian co-ordinates \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n{\\mathbf{e}}_x &= \\frac{\\partial {\\mathbf{r}}}{\\partial x}/\\left|\\frac{\\partial {\\mathbf{r}}}{\\partial x}\\right|\n\\\\ &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} [x,\\,y] / \\left|\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} [x,\\,y]\\right|\n\\\\ &= [1,0] / \\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2}\n\\\\ &= [1,0].\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe also define the scale factors \\(h_\\rho\\) and \\(h_\\phi\\) as the magnitude of the derivatives \\[h_\\rho = \\left|\\frac{\\partial {\\mathbf{r}}}{\\partial \\phi}\\right| = 1,\\] \\[h_\\phi = \\left|\\frac{\\partial {\\mathbf{r}}}{\\partial \\phi}\\right| = \\rho.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nScale factors will be useful later in the module. For now just get used to the formulas.",

    "text": "Notating vectors\nYou’re used to the idea that co-ordinates and basis vectors are kind of interchangable. In Cartesians, the point \\((x,y)\\) has position vector \\[\n{\\mathbf{r}} = [x,y] = x {\\mathbf{e}}_x + y {\\mathbf{e}}_y.\n\\] We reserve this square bracket notation for Cartesians, because it doesn’t work in curvilinear co-ordinates.\nAt a point with co-ordinates \\((\\rho,\\phi)\\) in plane polars, the position vector is \\[\n{\\mathbf{r}} = [x,y] = [\\rho \\cos \\phi,\\, \\rho\\sin\\phi] = \\rho {\\mathbf{e}}_\\rho.\n\\] Where does \\(\\phi\\) appear in this expression? The answer is that it’s hidden inside the \\({\\mathbf{e}}_\\rho\\). You have to know the co-ordinates to understand this position vector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI think this is the most confusing thing in this module. If you understand this everything else will be easier.",
