In this case, \\(t\\) can have any value because the line is infinitely long.\n\nThink: What’s a parameterisation for the line segment between two points \\({\\mathbf{p}}\\) and \\({\\mathbf{q}}\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nIn MA12001 you saw that this line has parameterisation \\[ {\\mathbf{r}} = {\\mathbf{p}} + ({\\mathbf{q}}-{\\mathbf{p}})t. \\] For a line segment, we need to limit the range of \\(t\\). Notice that when \\(t=0\\), \\({\\mathbf{r}}={\\mathbf{p}}\\), and when \\(t=1\\), \\({\\mathbf{r}}={\\mathbf{q}}\\), so we have to choose \\[\n0\\leq t \\leq 1.\n\\]",
