    "text": "In some ways these are the easiest integrals we see in this module. It’s basically the same steps as before:\n\nParameterise the volume.\nFind the element \\(dV\\) for that parameterisation.\nReplace the integral \\(\\int_V\\) with ordinary integrals \\(\\int_a^b\\) with the correct limits.\nCompute the value of the triple integral.\n\nHowever, the parameterisation of 3D volume needs 3 parameters, and we already know how to parameterise 3D space: that’s a co-ordinate system. So it’s a case of choosing the co-ordinate system which best describes the volume you’re interested in, and working out the correct limits. The element \\(dV\\) for a given co-ordinate system is the product of the scale factors.\nFor Cartestians, \\[\ndV = h_x h_y h_z \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz = dx\\,dy\\,dz,\n\\] for cylindrical polars, \\[\ndV = h_\\rho h_\\phi h_z \\,d\\rho\\,d\\phi\\,dz = \\rho d\\rho\\,d\\phi\\,dz,\n\\] and for spherical polars, \\[\ndV = h_r h_\\phi h_\\theta \\,dr\\,d\\phi\\,d\\theta = r^2\\sin \\theta \\,dr\\,d\\phi\\,d\\theta.\n\\]\n\nExample: volume of a sphere\nCalculate the volume of the sphere \\(x^2+y^2+z^2 \\leq R^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe volume is the empty integral \\[\n\\text{Volume} = \\int_V dV.\n\\]\nWe use spherical polar coordinates, where \\(x = r\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi\\), \\(y = r\\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi\\), \\(z = r\\cos\\theta\\), and \\(dV = r^2 \\sin\\theta \\, dr\\, d\\theta\\, d\\phi\\).\nThe limits are \\(0 \\leq r \\leq R\\), \\(0 \\leq \\theta \\leq \\pi\\), \\(0 \\leq \\phi \\leq 2\\pi\\).\nSo, \\[\n\\text{Volume} = \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_0^\\pi d\\theta dr\\,\\int_0^R r^2  \\sin\\theta = (2\\pi) \\left( \\int_0^\\pi \\sin\\theta\\, d\\theta \\right) \\left( \\int_0^R r^2 dr \\right).\n\\] Notice how we can do each of the integrals separately in this case.\n\\(\\int_0^\\pi \\sin\\theta\\, d\\theta = 2\\), and \\(\\int_0^R r^2 dr = \\frac{R^3}{3}\\).\nTherefore, the volume is \\(2\\pi \\times 2 \\times \\frac{R^3}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\nCalculate the volume integral \\[\n\\int_V z^3 dV\n\\] where \\(V = \\{(x,y,z)\\in\\mathbb{R}\\,|\\,0\\leq z\\leq 1,\\,x^2+y^2\\leq z^2\\}\\).\nHint: this is a cone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe set is given in Cartesian co-ordinates, but don’t let that fool you: it will get very messy if you try to do this in Cartesians.\nThe \\(x^2+y^2\\) should make you think of cylindrical co-ordinates, since \\(\\rho^2=x^2+y^2\\). Then you get \\[V = \\{(\\rho,\\phi,z)\\,|\\,0\\leq z\\leq 1,\\,\\rho\\leq z\\},\\] which is more obviously a cone (sketch in the \\(\\phi=0\\) plane).\nImplicit in this definition is that \\(\\phi\\) can take any value between \\(0\\) and \\(2\\pi\\) as usual.\nSo now we can put it all together: \\[\n\\int_V z^3 dV = \\int_0^z d\\rho \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_0^1 dz z^3 \\rho,\n\\] with the extra \\(\\rho\\) coming from thee scale factor \\(h_\\phi\\).\nThe \\(\\phi\\) integral is easy because \\(\\phi\\) does not appear in the integrand. We need to be careful with the order of the other two, because the limits for \\(\\rho\\) depend on \\(z\\): \\[\n\\int_V z^3 dV = 2\\pi  \\int_0^1 z^3 \\left(\\int_0^z \\rho d\\rho\\right) dz = 2\\pi \\int_0^1 z^3\\, \\frac{1}{2} z^2 dz = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]",

This is because we need to go the opposite direction from usual, from the diagram.

Now we’ll think about vector fields, that is, assigning a magnitude and a direction to every point in space.
