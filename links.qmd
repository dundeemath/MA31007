- My notes for the vectors stuff of MA12001 are here: <https://dundeemath.github.io/MA12001-algebra/_site/>. This module builds directly on this (particularly chapters 1 and 3) so it may be helpful to revise this.

- Most of the important results in this module are here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus_identities>. Your formula sheet in the exam should be based off this.

- The curvilinear co-ordinate results are summarised here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del_in_cylindrical_and_spherical_coordinates>.
