Stokes' theorem is one form of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in three dimensions, and it relates surface integrals to line integrals. Specifically, it says that
$$
\int_S (\nabla \times \vv{F})\cdot d\vv{S} = \int_{\partial S} \vv{F} \cdot d\vv{s}.
$$
The only thing that's new here is the curve $\partial S$. It says that

:::{.callout-important}
The flux integral of the curl of a vector field over a surface $S$ is the line integral of the vector field over $\partial S$.
:::

We won't attempt a proof of this theorem, though in class we'll see some intuition behind it. It is possible to prove it with techniques you know, but once you learn differential geometry it's a special case of a much easier theorem.

## The boundary of a surface
The symbol $\partial S$ is the boundary of the surface $S$.^[Why do we use the same symbol as for partial derivatives, you may wonder? This will require proper differential geometry to understand, for now it's just a coincidence.] The surface is a 2D object, and the boundary is a curve, a 1D object. Specifically, given the direction the normal is pointing, the boundary obeys the right-hand rule as per the diagram.

**Think**: what's the boundary of the surface $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$, $z\geq 0$.

## Solution
This is a hemisphere. Hopefully you can immediately spot the boundary, but if not, try substituting the condition $z\geq 0$ at its limit, i.e. $z=0$, into the equation $x^2+y^2+z^2=0$.

So we get
$x^2+y^2=0$, $z=0$, which is a circle.

I didn't tell you the direction of the normal, so you can't tell me which way this is oriented.
:::

Sometimes, the boundary of a surface has multiple parts. In this case, you can split the line integral into several simpler ones, making sure that at each separate curve, the right-hand rule is respected. The example below should make this a bit clearer.

## Conditions
For the theorem to apply, the surface $S$ has to be _oriented_. That means that the normal is well-defined everywhere on the surface. 

Most things you can think of are orientable: a sphere, a sheet of paper, a donut. You then have to choose which direction the normal goes and it becomes _oriented_.

The usual counter example is the Mobius band: this doesn't have a well defined normal, because you can point it one way, and then follow it all the way around the band and it's suddenly pointing the opposite way.

### Example
Let $S$ be the curved surface of the cylinder $x^2+y^2=1$, $0\leq z\leq 2$, with normal pointing out. Evaluate the integral
$$
\int_S \left(\nabla\times [z^2,x^2,y^2]\right) \cdot d\vv{S}
$$
both directly and using Stokes' theorem.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution

First, sketch the surface to understand it and its boundary.

### Directly
The obvious parameterisation is, taking inspiration from cylindrical co-ordinates,
$$
[x,y,z] = [\cos u,\sin u, v]\qquad 0\leq u<2\pi,\,0\leq v \leq 2.
$$

Then we have
$$
d\vv{S} = \pd{\vv{r}}{u}\times\pd{\vv{r}}{v} du\, dv = [-\sin u,\cos u,0]\times[0,0,1] du\,dv = [\cos u,\sin u,0] du\,dv
$$
and this normal does point out, as we want.

The integrand is
$$\nabla\times [z^2,x^2,y^2] = [2y, 2z, 2x] = [2\sin u,2v,2\cos u]$$
so putting it all together,
$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_S \left(\nabla\times [z^2,x^2,y^2]\right) \cdot d\vv{S} &= \int_0^{2\pi} du \int_0^2 dv [2\sin u,2v,2\cos u]\cdot[\cos u,\sin u,0]\\
&=\int_0^{2\pi} du \int_0^2 dv \left(2\sin u \cos u + 2v\sin u\right)\\
&=\int_0^{2\pi} du \int_0^2 dv \left(\sin 2u + 2v\sin u\right)\\
&= \int_0^{2\pi} du \left(2\sin 2u + 4\sin u\right)\\
&= 0.
\end{aligned}
$$

### Stokes theorem
We need to evaluate
$$
\int_{\partial S} [z^2,x^2,y^2] \cdot d\vv{s},
$$
but crucially $\partial S$ has two parts, that we will call $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$, and we write $\partial S = \gamma_1+\gamma_2$.

![](figures/f13.jpg){width=50%}

For $\gamma_1$, we parameterise
$$[x,y,z] = [\cos t,\,\sin t,\,0], \qquad 0\leq t < 2\pi.$$
Then $d\vv{s} = [-\sin t,\cos t,0]dt$ so the integral is
$$
\int_{\gamma_1} [z^2,x^2,y^2] \cdot d\vv{s} = \int_0^{2\pi} [0,\cos^2 t,\sin^2 t]\cdot [-\sin t,\cos t,0]dt = 
\int_0^{2\pi} \cos^3 t\, dt = 0.
$$

For $\gamma_2$, we parameterise
$$[x,y,z] = [\cos t,\,-\sin t,\,2], \qquad 0\leq t < 2\pi.$$
Notice the extra minus sign! This is because we need to go the opposite direction from usual, from the diagram.
Now $d\vv{s} = [\sin t,\cos t,0]dt$ so the integral is
$$
\int_{\gamma_2} [z^2,x^2,y^2] \cdot d\vv{s} = \int_0^{2\pi} [4,\cos^2 t,\sin^2 t]\cdot [\sin t,\cos t,0]dt = 
\int_0^{2\pi} \left(4\sin t + \cos^3 t\right)\, dt = 0.
$$
So overall
$$
\int_S \left(\nabla\times [z^2,x^2,y^2]\right) \cdot d\vv{S}=\int_{\partial S} [z^2,x^2,y^2] \cdot d\vv{s} = \int_{\gamma_1} [z^2,x^2,y^2] \cdot d\vv{s} + \int_{\gamma_2} [z^2,x^2,y^2] \cdot d\vv{s} = 0,
$$
which is exactly the same answer as we got before!

:::{.callout-tip}
To change the direction of a line integral, you can just subtract the integral instead of changing the direction of the parameterisation.

## Closed surface
A closed surface is one that has an "inside" and an "outside" - the surface forms a barrier in 3D space. Think of a bubble, or a donut.

**Think**: What's the boundary of a closed surface? How does Stokes' theorem apply?

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution
It doesn't have a boundary! So the right-hand side of Stoke's theorem is zero, and we just have
$$
\int_S (\nabla \times \vv{F})\cdot d\vv{S} = 0
$$
:::

For a closed surface, we sometimes use the symbol $\oint$. The theorem is
$$
\oint_S (\nabla \times \vv{F})\cdot d\vv{S} = 0
$$
and this is most obviously a connection between integration and differentiation: the flux integral and the curl are basically opposites for a closed surface.

## Example
Using Stokes' theorem and the fact that
$$
\nabla \times [xz,\,xy,\,yz] = [z,x,y],
$$
evaluate the integral
$$
\oint_S [x+z,\,y+x,\,z+y]\cdot d\vv{S}
$$
where $S$ is the sphere $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution
Obviously we could compute this integral directly, but the question wants us to use the theorem. It's not exactly in the form we need, but notice
$$[x+z,\,y+x,\,z+y] = [x,y,z]+[z,x,y] = \hat{\vv{n}} + \nabla \times [xz,\,xy,\,yz].$$

So then
$$
\oint_S [x+z,\,y+x,\,z+y]\cdot d\vv{S} = \oint_S \hat{\vv{n}} \cdot \hat{\vv{n}} dS + \oint_S \left(\nabla \times [xz,\,xy,\,yz]\right) \cdot d\vv{S}.
$$
The second integral is zero by the divergence theorem, because $S$ is a closed surface. 

A unit vector dotted with itself is 1, so the first integral simplies to
$$\oint_S  dS = 4\pi,$$
the surface area of $S$, which is the final answer.
