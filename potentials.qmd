The final part of our module concerns special types of vector fields.

We call a field $\v{A}$ _solenoidal_ if
$$
\nabla\cdot \v{A} = 0
$$
and we call a field $\v{B}$ _irrotational_ if
$$
\nabla\times\v{B} = \v{0}.
$$

:::{.callout-note}
A field can be both solenoidal and irrotational, for example any constant field. But in general they are different things.
:::

## Irrotational fields
These are sometimes called _curl free_ fields, for obvious reasons. The key theorem is:

:::{.callout-important}
$$\nabla\times\v{A} = \v{0} \text{ if and only if }\v{A} = \nabla \phi\text{ for some scalar field }\phi.$$
:::

We call $\phi$ a _scalar potential_ for $\v{A}$. 

Proving $\impliedby$ is easy:
If $\v{A} = \nabla \phi$ then
$$
\nabla\times \v{A} = \nabla \times \nabla \phi = 0,
$$
this was one of our second derivative identities.

The proof in the other direction is much more complicated, but for any given example you can make it work.

### Example
Find a scalar potential for
$$
\v{A} = [x^2,y^2,0].
$$

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution
First check that $\nabla\times\v{A}=\v{0}$, otherwise it doesn't work.

Then we need to find $\phi$ such that $\nabla \phi = [x^2,y^2,0]$.

Maybe you can spot it directly, but otherwise we can break it down. We need to find $\phi(x,y,z)$ such that
$$
\begin{aligned}
\pd{\phi}{x} &= x^2,\qquad\text{(1)} \\
\pd{\phi}{y} &= y^2,\qquad\text{(2)}\\
\pd{\phi}{z} &= 0.\qquad\text{(3)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Integrating the (1), we have
$$\phi(x,y,z) = \frac{1}{3} x^3 + C_1(y,z)$$
Here $C_1$ is just a normal constant of integration, but because we integrated a partial derivative, this constant can depend on $y$ and $z$.

Then (2) becomes
$$\pd{C_1}{y} = y^2$$
so
$$
C_1 = \frac{1}{3} y^3 + C_2(z).$$
$C_1$ depends only on $y$ and $z$, so the new constant of integration $C_2$ depends only on $z$.
So we have
$$
\phi = \frac{1}{3}x^3 + \frac{1}{3}y^3 + C_2(z),
$$
so (3) gives
$$
\frac{dC_2}{dz} = 0
$$
so $C_2$ is just a constant.

So finally we have
$$
\phi(x,y,z) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 + \frac{1}{3}y^3 + C_2,
$$
where $C_2$ is any constant.

Scalar potentials are not unique - you can add any constant to $\phi$ and it's still valid.
:::

## Solenoidal fields
These are also called _incompressible_ or _divergence free_. The key theorem here is:

:::{.callout-important}
$$\nabla\cdot\v{A} = \v{0} \text{ if and only if }\v{A} = \nabla\times \v{B}\text{ for some vector field }\v{B}.$$
:::

We call $\v{B}$ a _vector potential_ for $\v{A}$.

:::{.callout-note}
In physics, the magnetic field is a solenoidal field (this is where the name comes from).

## Solution
This works the same as for scalar potentials, but it gets much messier. I strongly recommend staring at it for 30 seconds to see if you can guess a potential that works, before trying as follows:
