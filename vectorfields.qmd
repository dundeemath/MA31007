Another thing that changes when moving from 1D to 3D is that we now have a choice of two types of functions, scalar fields or vector fields. Now we'll think about vector fields,
that is, assigning a magnitude and a direction to every point in space. Think about those wind maps on the weather forecast, or magnetic field lines around a magnet.

To know a vector field, we need to know each of its components at each point in space.
$$
\v{F}(x,y,z) = F_1(x,y,z)\v{e}_x + F_2(x,y,z)\v{e}_y + F_3(x,y,z)\v{e}_z,
$$
or equivalently in a different co-ordinate system.

Firstly, given any vector field we can easily construct a scalar field by taking the magnitude at each point in space, 
$$
\left|\v{F}(x,y,z)\right|=\sqrt{F_1(x,y,z)^2 + F_2(x,y,z)^2 + F_3(x,y,z)^2}
$$
and then take scalar derivatives. More on that next week.

We consider two different types.

# The divergence of a vector field
This one takes a vector field and gives the answer as a scalar field, and the interpretation is "how much is the vector field pointing apart."
In Cartesian co-ordinates, the definition is
$$
\nabla\cdot \v{F} = \pd{F_1}{x} + \pd{F_2}{y} + \pd{F_3}{z}.
$$

# The curl of a vector field
This one takes a vector field and gives another vector field, and the interpretation is "how much is the vector field rotating." It's a vector because the direction represents the _axis of rotation_ and

Just like the cross product, the curl is only defined in three dimensions. Sometimes people talk about 2D curls, but they're a bit different and much less important, so we'll ignore this.
